Hello! 

Today we're going to try something new and play around with some vanilla javascript! 

Here's a link to the video:

A tip before starting: 
    find at least 4 different hex codes of colors you like.
    If you don't care, here are some for you to copy and paste. 
    Enjoy <3

    const colors = [
    '#00a7f4',
    '#009d4c',
    '#ffbc20',
    '#f37719',
    '#ca251e',
    ]
